# SheltreX - Botnet builder built on Elasticsearch and Kibana with the help of C++ and Python

<-- The repository is under development. The whole code will be release by 15th April 2018 -->

Below are the features of the BotNet Server
1. The BotNet Server is fully writtent in Python3 with multithreading support to control multiple bots are one point of time
2. The sample Bot code will be fully undetectable when this will be released. The code is written in C++ using WINAPI and further development depends upon the user using it.
3. The obfuscate_vba can be used to supply payloads to the script which will create obfuscated payloads of VBA for macro word malwares

Since I am the only developer, it may take time for me to fix the bugs. Feel free to submit issues, pull request and fork.
